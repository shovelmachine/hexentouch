This is a port of Raven Software's (and id Software's) Hexen that I did for the Apple iPhone in about a week. The code is pretty straightforward with the more interesting parts being the input, sound and rendering frontend that was created specifically for the iPhone. I got a chance to show it off to the id guys a few months ago and I think they really liked it. I'm hoping we'll see an official port at some point in the future.

To run you'll need to have the SDK installed. You'll also need a demo or retail wad file (all the game content) in the root code directory (please do not ask me for one).

Disclaimer: This project is completely unsupported. This is just my attempt to get the source out there for educational purposes. Any issues you may have with it are not my responsibility, though I'd be glad to offer advice.

Big thanks to Rich Whitehouse who did the HexenDS (Nintendo DS) port that served as the basis for this port. Your help was invaluable!
